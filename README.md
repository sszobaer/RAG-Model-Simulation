## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using `transformers`, `datasets`, and `faiss` libraries. The system performs document retrieval and generates answers using a language model, allowing the combination of retrieval and generation to improve answer accuracy.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `datasets`
- `faiss-cpu`
- `tqdm`

You can install these dependencies using the following command:
```xml
<code>
pip install torch transformers datasets faiss-cpu tqdm
</code>

If you're using Google Colab, make sure to enable the GPU by navigating to Runtime > Change runtime type > Hardware accelerator > GPU.

## Setup

### Load the Corpus
The corpus consists of a list of text documents. You can replace the sample corpus with your own set of documents.

```xml
from datasets import Dataset

documents = [
    "What is machine learning?",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.",
    "It involves training models on data to make predictions."
]

# Convert the corpus into a Hugging Face Dataset
dataset = Dataset.from_dict({"text": documents})
```
### Create a FAISS Index for Retrieval
A FAISS index is created by embedding the corpus using a transformer model, and then indexing the embeddings for fast retrieval.

```xml
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import faiss
import torch

# Load a transformer model (BERT for embeddings)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

def embed_documents(texts):
    """Embed the texts using the transformer model."""
    inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = model(**inputs).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
    return embeddings.numpy()

# Embed the corpus and build a FAISS index
embeddings = embed_documents(dataset["text"])
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings.shape[1])  # L2 distance for retrieval
index.add(embeddings)  # Add embeddings to the index
```
### Perform Retrieval
You can now query the FAISS index to retrieve the most relevant documents.

```xml
def retrieve(query, top_k=3):
    """Retrieve top_k documents for a given query."""
    query_embedding = embed_documents([query])
    distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, top_k)
    
    results = [dataset[i.item()]["text"] for i in indices[0]]
    return results

# Test the retriever
query = "What is AI?"
print("Retrieved documents:", retrieve(query))
```

### Generate an Answer Using a Language Model
Once the relevant documents are retrieved, you can concatenate them and pass them to a language model to generate a response.

```xml
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a language model pipeline
qa_pipeline = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

# Generate a response based on the retrieved documents
retrieved_docs = retrieve("What is AI?")
context = " ".join(retrieved_docs)
response = qa_pipeline(context, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)

print("Generated answer:", response[0]["generated_text"])
```

## Example Output
For a query like What is AI?, the system will first retrieve the most relevant documents from the corpus and then use the GPT-2 model to generate an answer based on the retrieved context.

### Sample Output:
```xml
Retrieved documents: 
[
    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence.",
    "What is machine learning?"
]

Generated answer: 
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence. It involves training models on data to make predictions.
```

### How It Works
- Document Embedding: The corpus is embedded using a pre-trained transformer model, such as sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2.
- FAISS Index: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to create an index of document embeddings to quickly retrieve the most relevant documents given a query.
- Text Generation: The retrieved documents are used as context to generate a response using a pre-trained language model, such as GPT-2.
Use Cases
- Question Answering: Improve the accuracy of answers by retrieving contextually relevant documents.
- Text Summarization: Use document retrieval to pull relevant content for summarization tasks.
- Information Retrieval Systems: Enhance search engines with document retrieval and generation capabilities.
